B000BJS4OY,Born To Run,product description the 30th anniversary edition of springsteens born to run is being released in a special box set including hammersmith odeon london 75 a film of bruces 1975 concert in london the new film wings for wheels the making of born to run and the classic album remastered also a 48 page booklet of previously unpublished photographs amazoncom the first retooling of any album in the mighty springsteen catalog is an exemplary labor of love by columbia the original 1975 release was the makeorbreak record of bruces career and arguably still his best collection of material it is presented here on one disc unsullied by outtakes or inferior versionsjust pristine digital remasters of those eight grittily romantic songs of street life that defined the artists signature styles the substantial bonuses are two new dvd programs one featuring a full concert performance by bruce and the e street band on their first date outside the us at londons hammersmith odeon in november 1975 and the other a making of documentary including band interviews and contemporary concert footage the whole handsome box truly honors a legendary recording while providing generous value for fans the meat of the bonus material is the london show a mythology has built around it that the band were so disorientated by travel and culture shock and bruce so enraged by labelgenerated hype that they gave one of the worst performances of their career primitively shot by todays standards the footage captures the brilliance of the relatively new bands ensemble playing highlights include a thunder road accompanied only by keyboards that opens the show fiery solos on kittys back a dynamic saint in the city and a number of songs that have long since been retired its certainly notable how pensive and joyless springsteen appears when compared to his later animated stadium persona but its also fun to see the far greater role as foil played by clarence clemons as he now testifies in the sleeve notes putting lie to the myth on that night they had gone for broke and as this writer can bear witness the british audience exalted the show as the arrival of the greatest live performer of his generation  rob stewart the best of bruce by guest editor steve perry  steve is the editorinchief of city pages newspaper in minneapolis minnesota the wild the innocent and the e street shuffle 1973 after a folkrockish debut album that bubbled with ideas and dense lyrical play this is where springsteen began to find his voice as a rocker and as a songwriter the prisoneroflove romanticism of rosalita and incident on 57th street hinted at what was coming and this early version of the e street bandjazzier and more spare than later versions thanks largely to david sanciouss pianosounds great if a little ragged these many years later born to run 1975 and darkness on the edge of town 1978 these two records which belong on any compilation of the top 100 rock albums of all time sketched the themes that he would spend his whole career chasing and defined the expectations fans would bring to his records ever after the first chords of born to run sounded like freedom itself the first time i heard them on the radio and the album lived up to them thunder road is still the greatest rock  roll love song anyones ever written the record sounded so big and impassioned and propulsive it was easy to miss the dread running underneath it darkness put the dread front and center there are more of his best songs here than anywhere else even if the sound is muddy and leaden at times nebraska 1982 after the river the best record that didnt make this list and the ensuing tour answered his rock  roll prayershe was a big star now not just a perennial critics favoritespringsteen holed up in a rented house on the jersey shore where he wrote these songs and sang them into a fourtrack recorder in his living room the tape was supposed to be a demo for the band but after several false tries he concluded that the tape hed been carrying around in his pocket was the record quiet and bleak nebraska nonetheless grabbed you by the collar and made you listen as surely as his rock  roll records ever had tunnel of love 1987 the glare and hubbub surrounding the born in the usa tour the tour was greatthe record itself overrated made him pull back again this time to write a cycle of songs about love and fear and selfdoubt after this springsteens first marriage broke up and he started a family with patti scialfa disappearing for the better part of 10 years notwithstanding the pair of notbad justdisappointing albums he released in 1992 human touch and lucky town  the ghost of tom joad 1995 some call it nebraska ii  but his second acoustic album was not a repeat of his firstthe characters and settings had changed and their circumstances were more expressly desperate and socialthough it did share the same interest in what happens to people whose isolation or marginal status renders them invisible the rising 2002 everybody including springsteen seemed to think it was a record about 911 but the subject was broaderdeath and loss as seen from
