sound less fuss I had a chance to audition a pair of the Jamo S 801 PM powered speakers recently It was easy to get them set up and playing music in my home office in just a few minutes This is the powered version of Jamos passive S 801 speakers  So it features the same attractive look and expansive sound that earned high marks from Crutchfield customers But in this case no extra amp or receiver is necessary I simply pulled them out of the box connected the left and right speaker with the included speaker wire and plugged them into an AC outlet From there I was able play music wirelessly from my phone via Bluetooth Then it was just all about positioning them the right distance from the wall so that the rearfiring port gave me the preferred amount of bass The Jamo S 801 PM powered speakers
